---
PackageCat is a Scratch extension made by Themeatly2 (themeatly2_ on Discord) for adding packages from popular CDN sites like NPM. It can also add stylesheets incase it needs them.
## Note
[Mistium](https://github.com/Mistium) has improved on this extension and has posted it on her extensions gallery [here](https://extensions.mistium.com/). I recommend you use that extension instead.
## Download
You can download this extension [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biggiecheesetherat/packagecat/main/PackageCat.js). It must run unsandboxed.
